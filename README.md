Proof of concept of what a git approach to theology lesson development could look like. 


## Leveraging Open Source Concepts to Theological Teaching

### The Problem

Across the world, the diverse Christian Church passes on its teachings in a mind-boggling array of contexts. For those charged with teaching, this presents a simple challenge: creating and finding quality educational materials that present concepts with the nuances appropriate for specific theological streams as well as contextualized for the local gathering of learners in a specific time. To meet the challenge, two broad approaches have been:

1. The production of material by experts aimed at large sets of churches. And,
2. The local production of by material by individual churches and teachers. 

Both present advantages and liabilities. In the church at large, the former approach produces better *quality* resources, the latter produces materials that address the specific needs of local learners. The former approach allows wide desemination of resources, but it locates power somewhat in well-financed theological streams while excluding others. The latter allows for a greater diversity of materials with increased theological nuancing, but these are less accessible to other communities. While the technological movements of the information age presents opportunities to increase the advantages and to mitigate the liabilities of each approach, while offering multiple hybrid models as well. Now there is an opportunity for a new model of development that may yield new advantagesâ€”and will inevitibally create new liabilities as well! This opportunity comes from the open source model that has blossomed through software industry over the last few years, and which continues to evolve with new concepts. 

### Leveragable Concepts

The Open Source Model of sofware development utilizes a number of technologies. Several are interesting for curriculum development. Consider not only how each of the following might be useful indepently, or as a part of other models, but also the potential synergy when developers use them all together. 

#### Open-source Distribution Increases Accessibility
Material released as open source can be used freely by a wide range of users. Coders then see the fruits of their software in new applications, benfiting more users. *Curriculum writers* would know the joy of seeing their material influence a broader circle of people. 

#### Push-Pull Mechanics Create Better Products
One-to-many influence, many-to-one, many-to-many

#### Multiple Branches allow diverse approaches.
